## Initial Thoughts

 - I started with created a diagram with all the connections and where I want all the foreign keys to connect

 - I have started my file structure with all the different folders for the models, schemas, controllers, etc

 - Now I'm going to take a dive into alembic before I create a raw SQL table. I want to see what I can do with alembic to streamline the process of creating the different tables, inserts, and connections
    - 

 - I want to go ahead and create the models that i have listed in my db diagram and connect that to the alembic command that will create the columns for each table created
   - do I want to try to work with feature branches to work on the models, schemas, routes, etc separately?
